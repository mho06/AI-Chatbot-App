There are five major oceans: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean (which is also considered part of the Antarctic region), and the Arctic Ocean. These oceans are home to a vast array of marine life and play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, regulating temperature, and producing over half of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere."

        "text": "While I can't physically solve a Rubik's Cube for you, I can certainly provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to solve a Rubik's Cube. Here's a simplified method called the \"beginner's method\" or the \"CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) method\":\n\n1. Cross:\n   - Solve the white cross on one face, keeping the other faces as mixed as possible.\n   - Solve the center (white) small edges opposite the solved cross edge.\n   - Solve the remaining white edge pieces.\n   - Finally, solve the two corners opposite the solved edges.\n\n2. First Two-layer Pair (F2L or Fish):\n   - Find a matching corner and edge piece that can be paired together which are on two adjacent layers.\n   - Insert the edge piece into its correct position in the white layer first, avoiding twisting or rotating the cube too much.\n   - Then place the corner piece into its proper position using the U, U', R, R', L, L', F or F' sides.\n   - Continue to pair the remaining F2L pieces.\n\n3. OLL (Orientation of Last Layer) and PLL (Permutation of Last Layer):\n   - There are 57 cases for OLL and 21 cases for PLL. The CFOP method solves each case using specific algorithms.\n   - You can find these algorithms in a guide or use an online database like this one: https://www.rubiks-online.com/algorithms/ollpll.html\n\nPractice helps you get faster at solving the Rubik's Cube. Good luck on your solving journey!"
